Democrats easily take the House [222, 213], Republicans keep a narrow hold over the Senate [51, 49]. 

Dear god please dont let Republicans gain any more ground things are already so bad like fascism is rising globally and at home and I am so small and tired please please

Voter registration rates are higher than ever and more digital platforms are being used to encourage voting. Higher turnouts usually result in bluer elections,and if registration rates translate to voter numbers, there should be progress for Democrats. A lot of these registrants are young voters who are particularly excited to vote because they were not of age when Trump was elected. 

Fingers crossed !!
